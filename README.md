## ✅ Task Overview

**TASK 1: Iris Flower Classification**

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species — **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica** — based on their morphological measurements.

---

## 📊 Features

- Utilizes the famous **Iris dataset** from Scikit-learn.
- Classification using ML algorithms such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Evaluation of model performance using:
  - **Confusion Matrix**
  - **Accuracy Score**
  - **R² Score**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- Visual representation using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Concepts Covered

- Supervised learning
- Classification
- Model training & testing
- Performance metrics

---

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `numpy`

---

## 🔎 Dataset Information

The Iris dataset contains **150 samples** with the following features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

Each sample is labeled with one of the species:
- **0 → Setosa**
- **1 → Versicolor**
- **2 → Virginica**
